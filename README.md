# Final Project for Capstone 2017

## Introduction

We are building a lie detection system that combines audio and video data of a subject to detect instances of deception. The idea is based on proven psycological research that shows that when an individual lies, there are changes in 
his/her voice (voice amplitude, energy, pitch, vowel duration etc.) and facial patterns (blink patterns, micro-expressions, gaze direction etc.) that can be tracked using software.

In the Video below, Cliff Lansley, Director of Emotional Intelligence Academy explains exactly what changes occur in a 
person's voice and facial patterns when he/she lies
